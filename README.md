# Variance-Reduced-Policy-Gradient

A research project for enhancing stability of Policy Gradient Algorithm

We try to add the variance of mont-carlo estimation as a penalty term to constrain variance in policy gradient method.

## Research Path

For the mathmatic induction and basic motivition , it could be referred in the Report1.pdf & Report2.pdf.

## Performance of Idea

The model hasn't been fully tested, till now , There is no suffcient advantage over the traditional Policy Grandient Method.

The experiemental result of comparing Atari Game, and a toy game is in logs.
